## 1. Overview

This repository contains an open source application to help assess if food is still edible or not. The actual content shown inside this application is contained and processed in repository [foodrescue-content](https://github.com/fairdirect/foodrescue-content).

**Features:**

* **Convergent.** The application runs from the same codebase and with the same user interface as a native (!) application on both phones, tablets and desktop computers. This is made possible by Qt5 and, based on that, the [KDE Kirigami](https://kde.org/products/kirigami/) framework.

* **Cross-platform.** The application is cross-platform, running on all platforms supported by the KDE Kirigami framework. As of 2020-06, these are: Android, iOS, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD ([see](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/blob/master/metainfo.yaml#L5)).

* **Scan to check.** To quickly find the required information about a food item, scan its GTIN barcode with the camera of your device.

* **Keyboard control.** The application can be fully controlled by keyboard shortcuts. That also works in the mobile variant, such as for Android based netbooks.

* **Desktop touch control.** As a side effect of convergent application development, the user interface is touch control friendly even on the desktop version. That's useful for the considerable amount of notebook computers with touchscreens.



**Documentation:**

* **Project website.** The project's website with introductory information and relevant links is [fairdirect.org/food-rescue-app](https://fairdirect.org/food-rescue-app).

* **API documentation.** The project's C++ source files contain in-code documentation that you can compile into full API docs with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

* **Other documentation.** Extensive project documentation about planned features, used technologies, frequent tasks and related projects and initiatives is available as a Dynalist document ["Food Rescue App Documentation"](https://dynalist.io/d/To5BNup9nYdPq7QQ3KlYa-mA). The same content is also available as an exported version under `doc/doc.html` in this repository. But the export is still rough and does not support proper navigation in the document, so at this time the Dynalist live document is preferable.

## 3. Installation

Right now, you would have to compile the software yourself from source ‚òπÔ∏è See sections [5.1. Development Setup](#51-development-setup) and [5.2. Build and Development Process](#52-build-and-development-process) below for that.

Eventually you will be able to install the software comfortably as follows:

* **For Android.** Install directly from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps). Or install from the [KDE Android F-Droid repository](https://community.kde.org/Android/FDroid), which also contains all other Kirigami based Android applications.

* **For iOS.** Install from the Apple App Store.

* **For Linux.** For Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and its variants, a Debian package is provided in a PPA package repository.

* **For Windows.** Download a self-extracting installer and install from there.

* **For Mac OS X.** Download a DMG package and install from there.


## 4. Usage

The following keyboard combinations are available:

* **Close the application.** Ctrl + Q (Kirigami default)
* **Select menu item.** Alt + highlighted letter while menu drawer is open


## 5. Development Guide

### 5.1. Development Setup and Build Process

**To install code and dependencies for development:**

1. **Install the required dependencies.** The dependencies are chosen to be matched by the newest Ubuntu LTS releases. So for example, from 2020-04 to 2022-04 ([see](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)), releases will be installable under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and you can use the packages from its standard repositories for development. (The project currently also builds under Ubuntu 19.10, but that is not guaranteed for the future.)

    If your distribution provides older versions of the following dependencies or you develop under Windows or Mac OS X, you have to install dependencies manually.

    * **KDE Kirigami 5.68.0 or higher.** [As provided](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/amd64/kirigami2-dev) under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and installed there with:

        ```
        sudo apt install kirigami2-dev libkf5kirigami2-doc
        ```

        To install Kirigami 5.68.0 manually, choose the corresponding commit `f47bf906` ([source](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/tags)). Avoiding a higher version can be necessary if it does not build with your system's Qt libraries otherwise.

    * **Qt 5.12.0 or higher.** [As required](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/blob/f47bf90/CMakeLists.txt#L8) by KDE Kirigami 5.68.0, [corresponding to commit `f47bf906`](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/tags). Under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, it is [installed automatically as a dependency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/amd64/libkf5kirigami2-5/5.68.0-0ubuntu2).

    * **Breeze icon theme.** Under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, install with:

        ```
        sudo apt install breeze-icon-theme
        ```

    * **Development tooling.** Under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, install with:

         ```
         sudo apt install build-essential cmake extra-cmake-modules
         ```

2. **Clone the repository.**

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:fairdirect/foodrescue-app.git
    ```

**To build the application from the command line:**

```
cd foodrescue-app
mkdir -p build/CommandLineBuild && cd build/CommandLineBuild
cmake ../..
cmake --build .
```

As an alternative to `cmake --build .`, you can also simply run `make`, because CMake is a tool that generates GNU Make makefiles.

(TODO: How to build the various targets, such as an Android APK etc.. How to deploy to a phone and run it there.)

**To build the application in Qt Creator:**

1. "File ‚Üí Open File or Project.." and open the project's `CMakeLists.txt`. (This is how you open CMake projects with Qt Creator.)

2. Select the "Projects" tab from the sidebar and configure the project's build targets (TODO: how).

3. In the lower left build control toolbar, select your build target and then click the large green "Run" button.


### 5.2. Qt Creator configuration

If you use Qt Creator as your IDE, here are ways to make developing for this (and other) applications pleasant and efficient:

1. **If not on Ubuntu: Adapt your `QML_IMPORT_PATH`.** The `QML_IMPORT_PATH` is needed for Qt Creator's code completion to work. Otherwise, it will complain at QML `import` statements but builds would still succeed. This application already defines `QML_IMPORT_PATH` for all required QML files as found in Ubuntu Linux based distributions, using [this technique](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62202304). If you're not on Ubuntu, you may have to add some directories, as follows:

    1. In Qt Creator, open the "Projects" sidebar tab and there go to "Build & Run ‚Üí [your build config's entry] ‚Üí Build ‚Üí CMake".

    2. In the list of CMake configuration settings, set the value of setting `QML_IMPORT_PATH` according to your system. To add multiple directories, separate them with "`;`".

### 5.5. Code Style Guide

The guiding idea is to write code that reads almost like natural language. That affects variable and method naming, source code layout and also choice of the logical flow and distributing algorithmic complexity so that one can understand everything while reading through once.

For C++ code, this means specifically:

TODO

And for QML code, this means specifically:

* **Visual order.** Order code elements as much as possible in the order they will appear in the user interface (top to bottom, left to right). If that means mixing contained QML types and QML attributes, so be it.
