# 1. Overview

This repository contains an open source application to help assess if food is still edible or not. The actual content shown inside this application is contained and processed in repository [foodrescue-content](https://github.com/fairdirect/foodrescue-content).

**Features:**

* **Convergent.** The application runs from the same codebase and with the same user interface as a native (!) application on both phones, tablets and desktop computers. This is made possible by Qt5 and, based on that, the [KDE Kirigami](https://kde.org/products/kirigami/) framework.

* **Cross-platform.** The application is cross-platform, running on all platforms supported by the KDE Kirigami framework. As of 2020-06, these are: Android, iOS, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD ([see](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/blob/master/metainfo.yaml#L5)).

* **Scan to check.** To quickly find the required information about a food item, scan its GTIN barcode with the camera of your device.

* **Keyboard control.** The application can be fully controlled by keyboard shortcuts. That also works in the mobile variant, such as for Android based netbooks.

* **Desktop touch control.** As a side effect of convergent application development, the user interface is touch control friendly even on the desktop version. That's useful for the considerable amount of notebook computers with touchscreens.


**Documentation:**

* **Project website.** The project's website with introductory information and relevant links is [fairdirect.org/food-rescue-app](https://fairdirect.org/food-rescue-app).

* **API documentation.** The project's C++ source files contain in-code documentation that you can compile into full API docs with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

* **Other documentation.** Extensive project documentation about planned features, used technologies, frequent tasks and related projects and initiatives is available as a Dynalist document ["Food Rescue App Documentation"](https://dynalist.io/d/To5BNup9nYdPq7QQ3KlYa-mA). The same content is also available as an exported version under `doc/doc.html` in this repository. But the export is still rough and does not support proper navigation in the document, so at this time the Dynalist live document is preferable.


# 2. Installation

Right now, you would have to compile the software yourself from source ☹️ See chapter [5. Development](#5-development) for that.

Eventually you will be able to install the software comfortably as follows:

* **For Android.** Install directly from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps). Or install from the [KDE Android F-Droid repository](https://community.kde.org/Android/FDroid), which also contains all other Kirigami based Android applications.

* **For iOS.** Install from the Apple App Store.

* **For Linux.** For Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and its variants, a Debian package is provided in a PPA package repository.

* **For Windows.** Download a self-extracting installer and install from there.

* **For Mac OS X.** Download a DMG package and install from there.


# 3. Usage

Tips for scanning a barcode, starting with the most important:

* **Align the lines.** Barcode scanning works only when the barcode lines are either vertical or horizontal on your screen, or slanted up to about 15° from that. When the lines are 45°, no barcodes are recognized due to software limitations.

* **Focus.** Barcodes cannot be recognized from out-of-focus camera images. So when you notice that the barcode lines appear blurred in your camera viewfinder, try the following: (1) Move the barcode further from the lens. Autofocus cameras have a minimum focus distance of 10-15 cm while manual focus webcams have to be adjusted by turning a focus ring and fixed focus webcams are usually configured to focus at 60 cm for a video call setup. (2) Move the barcode centrally into the viewfinder, because that is where an autofocus camera will try to focus on by default. (3) Get more light to shine on the barcode, because the autofocus has issues focusing when contrast is too low.

* **Plain and steady.** Hold the barcode parallel to the camera lens and keep it steady for a few seconds. That is the best way to get a scan. The camera simply needs up to a few seconds to adjust exposure and focus to capture the barcode perfectly. This is a gradual process, so if you change something in the scene too early to "help" the camera, it will just slow down the barcode scanning as the camera has to start its adjustment process again.

* **Not exactly parallel is ok.** It does not matter if the barcode plane is not exactly parallel to the camera lens. The barcode will appear slightly distorted in the camera viewfinder, but be detected with the same speed and precision.

* **Lighting.** Good and even lighting is important for fast barcode recognition. Barcode recognition usually works acceptably with usual indoor lighting levels, but can become difficult the smaller the barcodes are.

* **Exposure.** Barcode recognition is very sensitive to overexposure of the barcode area, but not much to underexposure. A dark camera image background leads to overexposure of the barcode's white area, so prefer a lit / light background. Or try moving the barcode closer to the camera so that less background is visible and won't influence the exposure so much.

* **Multiple barcodes.** In rare cases there can be misreadings if more than one barcode is visible and barcodes overlap partially. Numbers would then not correspond to either barcode. Overlapping barcodes will not happen in live usage, but might when testing with pieces of paper.

The following keyboard combinations are available:

* **Auto-complete related.** It works the same as in a Google Search:

    * **Edit mode.** F2 will always put the cursor back into the autocomplete field.
    * **Next / previous completion.** Arrow Down / Arrow Up.
    * **Choose completion.** Return or Enter.
    * **Close completion box.** Escape.
    * **Close and leave completion box.** Press Escape twice. It will move the keyboard focus to the browser so you can keyboard-scroll there afterwards.

* **Content browser related.**

    * **Scroll a bit.** Arrow Up / Arrow Down.
    * **Scroll one page.** Page Up / Page Down.

* **Kirigami defaults.**
    * **Activate menu item.** Alt + highlighted letter while menu drawer is open.
    * **Page back / forward.** Alt + Arrow Left / Alt + Arrow Right. You can also use the hardware keys "Page Back" and "Page Forward" if you have them. Not found often, but for example some Lenovo ThinkPad models have these above the Arrow Left / Arrow Right keys.
    * **Move focus.** Tab moves the keyboard focus to the next element, Shift + Tab moves it to the previous element.
    * **Click on focused element.** The Space bar key is like clicking on the element currently having the keyboard focus. Except for text fields, where you need Return or Enter.
    * **Close overlay sheet.** There is no default key binding for this. Esc does not work. Some applications bind the "Alt + Left" and "Page Back" keys to this, for example the Kirigami Gallery demo application.
    * **Close the application.** Ctrl + Q.

* TODO: Complete this list. There should be an official list somewhere.

TODO: Complete the usage instructions.


# 4. Repository Layout

Here is a quick overview of what you'll find where and why.

**General source layout:** We make use of the Ubuntu operating system packages as much as possible to provide dependencies (libraries and header files).

Some dependencies cannot be installed that way, including all cross-compiled libraries for Android etc.. These other dependencies are self-compiled, placed into their own independent directories just like this application itself, all having their own "CMake buildsystem" as they say. Sadly, some exceptions are necessary so that some libraries have to be placed into this application's source tree; see the documentation for the `lib/` folder below.

In all the above cases, dependencies are connected to this application only via the CMake `find_package(…)` mechanism. That's the most compact and cross-platorm compatible way to manage dependencies in CMake.

**In the repository:**

* **📁 `build/`:** Proposed out-of-source location for build process output. Use sub-directories per platform (`desktop`, `android`, `ios` etc.) and per type of build (delease, debug etc.).

* **📁 `doc/`:** Any project documentation besides this main `README.md` and besides the API documentation generated by Doxygen.

* **📁 `install/`:** Proposed out-of-source location for `make install` output. Needed as part of the Android build process to have a location of all files that should make it into the Android APK package. Use sub-directories per platform (`desktop`, `android`, `ios` etc.).

* **📁 `lib/`:** External libraries that contain QML, which necessitates to place them below the repository root during the build process [due to a limitation of `qmlimportscanner`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62326971), the program that runs to find all QML files that have to be included into the APK package. The libraries are managed as their own Git repositories but have to be placed here for the build to succeed. In our case, you would put Kirigami here.

* **📁 `src/`:** The project's actual source code.

* **📄 `CMakeLists.txt`:**

* **📄 `CMakeLists.txt.user.template`:**

* **📄 `LICENSE.md`:** The main licence file.

* **📄 `README.md`:** This README.

* **📄 `metadata-*`:** Application metadata for various environments. Informs a desktop environment where to put the application into the start menu, what icon to use etc..


# 5. Development Guide

The following chapters provide a setup to build Food Rescue App under Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS. The instructions are mostly the same under Ubuntu 19.10 and under other Ubuntu flavors and other [Debian (Testing) based Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian_%28Testing%29_based). But if you are setting up your development environment under Windows or Mac OS X, you are so far on your own; you can however learn the required versions of Android SDK, NDK, Qt, KDE ECM and Kirigami from the instructions below.


## 5.1. Dependencies Overview

The dependencies of Food Rescue App are chosen to be matched by the newest current Ubuntu LTS release. So for example, Food Rescue App releases between 2020-04 and 2022-04 ([see](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)) will be installable under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and you will be able to use default Ubuntu 20.04 LTS repository packages for its development. If your distribution provides older versions of the dependencies listed below, or you develop under Windows or Mac OS X, you have to install dependencies manually. There are a few exceptions from this rule of sticking to Ubuntu LTS packages:

* The project currently also builds under Ubuntu 19.10, but that is not guaranteed for the future.
* In cases where a version of Food Rescue App needs a package in a newer version than provided in the current Ubuntu LTS release, it will use the package versions provided in [Kubuntu Backports](https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/backports). These might be not the latest releases either, but are easy to add on top of a normal Ubuntu distribution by adding a PPA. In contrast, KDE Neon is a Ubuntu LTS based distribution providing the most cutting edge versions, but adding that on top of a usual Ubuntu installation is messy and can lead to dependency hell.


#### Dependencies for Android development

When only building the desktop version of this application, any Qt >5.12 will fulfill the requirements of Kirigami and should work with the tooling provided by your Linux distribution. When you also want to build the Android application, it gets complicated. For Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, it is the safest to follow the development setup instructions in this document to end up with the right versions (the desktop development setup already chooses versions that can also be used for Android development). If you need other versions, see the table below.

To find out the versions you have installed:

   ```
   apt-cache show extra-cmake-modules | grep "Version:"
   # TODO: version check for Android NDK and Qt
   ```

To find the version of [extra-cmake-modules](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules) ("ECM") you need for a chosen combination of Android NDK and Qt:

|                         | **NDK 18**    | **NDK 19**    | **NDK 20**    | **NDK 21** |
|-------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Qt 5.12 for Android** | ECM ≥5.62.0   | n/a           | n/a           | n/a        |
| **Qt 5.13 for Android** | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a        |
| **Qt 5.14 for Android** | ECM ≥5.68.0   | n/a           | n/a           | n/a        |
| **Qt 5.15 for Android** | ?             | n/a           | n/a           | n/a        |

What makes the versions in the table necessary:

While the Android platform and Qt library interfaces are mature and almost always backwards compatible, this is not true for the build process. New versions of Android NDK and Qt often introduce changes that necessitate changing build tools that rely on them. For Kirigami, the Android build process is mostly handled by [KDE extra-cmake-modules](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules) ("ECM").

* **Android NDK 19 and 20 support.** Support for Android NDK 20 exists since ECM [commit c9ebd39](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/commit/c9ebd39), corresponding to version 5.68.0. Since some of the changes that make Android NDK 20 incompatible with previous ECM versions are also present in NDK 19 ([see](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/qt-android-cmake/blob/5a62962/AddQtAndroidApk.cmake#L172)), we infer that ECM 5.68.0 or newer is needed for NDK 19 as well. However there is an additional issue (TODO: link) that makes ECM incompatible with Android NDK ≥19. As of 2020-06-10, there is no fix, as even the now-current version ECM 5.71.0 exhibits this issue.

* **Qt 5.13 support.** The [commit c9ebd39](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/commit/c9ebd39) message tells that even in that version, Qt 5.13 has issues with "older NDKs", which we assume here to mean versions before Android NDK 19. In the commits until 2020-06-08, there is no indication that these issues were fixed.

* **Qt 5.14 support.** When trying Qt ≥5.14 for Android with ECM 5.62, you would see `androiddeployqt` fail during the build process with the error message "No target architecture defined in json file". This seems to be due to the same change in Qt that also caused the equivalent issues [#35](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/qt-android-cmake/issues/35) in [qt-android-cmake](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/qt-android-cmake) and [#23306](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-23306) in the CMake scripts for Android deployment that come with Qt Creator. It has to be fixed in every set of CMake scripts that for Android deployment, and ECM is yet another one of these. It was fixed with ECM [commit c9ebd39](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/commit/c9ebd39) – see the commit message there. That commit was on 2020-03-03 and the [Git tag list](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/-/tags) shows it landed in 5.68.0.


## 5.2. Desktop Development Setup

1. **Install basic development tooling.** Under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, install with:

     ```
     sudo apt install build-essential cmake
     ```

2. **Install Extra CMake Modules (ECM).** Under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you can install them with:

    ```
    sudo apt install extra-cmake-modules
    ```

    However, if you want to work with Qt ≥5.14 and / or Android NDK ≥19, you need ECM ≥5.68.0. In that case, install them with:

    ```
    git clone https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules.git
    cd extra-cmake-modules

    # Adapt to the commit of a stable version ≥5.68.0, here 5.72.0. Find the version tag commit hashes on
    # https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/-/tags
    git checkout ada528dc

    mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
    make

    # Adapt to the version you checked out, here 5.72.0.
    sudo checkinstall --pkgname extra-cmake-modules --pkgversion 5.72.0 make install
    ```

3. **Install Qt 5.12.0 or up to 5.13.2.** Qt 5.12.0 or higher [is required](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/blob/f47bf90/CMakeLists.txt#L8) by KDE Kirigami 5.68.0. Under Ubuntu this is installed automatically as a [dependency of Kirigami](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/amd64/libkf5kirigami2-5/5.68.0-0ubuntu2) (see below). Ubuntu 20.04 LTS provides Qt 5.12.5 while Ubuntu 19.10 provides Qt 5.12.4 ([see](https://reposcope.com/package/qt5-default)).

    In principle, you could also install Qt 5.13 or higher. Qt 5.13 or higher for desktop Linux applications as installed here works fine out of the box. However, it is advisable to keep the Qt versions for desktop Linux and Android the same to avoid surprises. And when installing Qt 5.13 or higher for Android, additional steps will be needed, as detailed in chapter [5.4. Android Development Setup](#54-android-development-setup) below.

4. **Install KDE Kirigami 5.68.0 or higher.** [As provided](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/amd64/kirigami2-dev) under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and installed there with:

    ```
    sudo apt install kirigami2-dev libkf5kirigami2-doc
    ```

    If you have to install Kirigami 5.68.0 manually, choose the corresponding commit `f47bf906` ([source](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/tags)). Avoiding a higher version can be necessary if it does not build with your system's Qt libraries otherwise.

    Note that KDE Kirigami is a lightweight library independent of the KDE Plasma desktop environment – it has no dependencies beyond Qt, and you don't need KDE Plasma installed to use it or develop for it.

5. **Install Qt5 development utilities.** Qt comes with some development tools. We'll need `xmlpatterns`, the XSLT processor utility, as it helps to test DocBook-to-HTML transformations developed for this software. Install it with:

    ```
    sudo apt install qtxmlpatterns5-dev-tools
    ```

6. **Make Qt5 your default Qt version.** If you have installed both Qt4 and Qt5 on your system, only one of them will be the default for same-named Qt binaries that you'll need during the development process. Build tools are not affected by this, as they will always call Qt binaries with a `-qt=5` argument to make sure they use Qt4 tools. But when using Qt binaries manually, not having Qt 5 as the default version is annoying. On Ubuntu `sudo apt install qt5-default` will make Qt5 the default, while on other systems you might have to deal with `qtchooser` ([details](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39742962)).

7. **Install [ZXing-C++](https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp).** This has to be compiled from source because we rely on a newer version than Ubuntu 20.04 [package zxing-cpp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zxing-cpp) (which anyway seems only available as a proposed package there right now). Commit 57c4a89 from 2020-06-25 is the last version that has been tested, and also the minimum necessary version (as it provides CMake package versioning that we rely on).

    We do a system-wide installation to keep `cmake` calls simple for desktop development. But we also use `checkinstall` (`sudo apt install checkinstall`) to create and install a simple Ubuntu package. That makes it much easier to uninstall all installed ZXing files again when necessary (`sudo apt remove zxing-cpp`).

    ```
    cd /some/out-of-source/path/
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp.git
    git checkout 57c4a89
    cd zxing-cpp
    mkdir -p build/linux-amd64 && cd build/linux-amd64

    cmake ../..
    make
    sudo checkinstall --pkgname zxing-cpp --pkgversion "1.0.8+57c4a89" --nodoc make install
    sudo ldconfig
    ```

8. **Install the remaining Qt header files (optional).** To be able to access all components of Qt in your code without having to install more packaged on demand, you can install all the Qt header files already:

    ```
    sudo apt install \
      libqt5gamepad5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libqt5sensors5-dev libqt5serialport5-dev \
      libqt5svg5-dev libqt5websockets5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev \
      qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev-tools \
      qtlocation5-dev qtpositioning5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qtscript5-dev \
      qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtwayland5-dev-tools qtxmlpatterns5-dev-tools
    ```

9. **Install the database.** The application relies on the database that is the build output of [project `foodrescue-content`](https://github.com/fairdirect/foodrescue-content). Since during development we'll want to run the application without installing it, we'll have to install the database manually:

    1. To build that database, follow [the project's README](https://github.com/fairdirect/foodrescue-content#readme). To install it.

    2. Select the directory where to install the database. This depends on your operating system. Select a suitable location with path type `AppLocalDataLocation` from [Qt's list of standard locations](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html#StandardLocation-enum). For Linux, this would be `~/.local/share/foodrescue/` or `/usr/local/share/foodrescue/`.

    3. Copy the database there, using filename `foodrescue-content.sqlite3`.

    4. Add the relevant indexes to the database. They increase database size by ~12% but reduce the query time of the typical queries in Food Rescue App from 44 s to 0.2 s.

        TODO: Add these indexes by default in the database build process, then remove the instruction from here.

        ```
        sqlite3 foodrescue-content.sqlite3 <<SQLEND
            CREATE INDEX idx_code ON products(code);
            CREATE INDEX idx_categories_topics ON topic_categories(category_id,topic_id);
        SQLEND
        ```


## 5.3. Desktop Build Process

You can also build this the Android application from inside Qt Creator. See chapter [5.6. Qt Creator Setup](#56-qt-creator-setup).

1. **Get the application source code** by cloning its repository:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:fairdirect/foodrescue-app.git
    ```

2. **Build the application.**

    ```
    cd foodrescue-app
    mkdir -p build/Desktop.CommandLineBuild && cd build/Desktop.CommandLineBuild
    cmake ../..
    cmake --build .

    # Optional: if you don't want to run the binary in place.
    make install
    ```

    As an alternative to `cmake --build .`, you can also simply run `make`, because CMake is a tool that generates GNU Make makefiles.

3. **Run the application.** To run the application in place without installing it, you'd do:

    ```
    ./bin/foodrescue
    ```

    If you have done the `make install` step, you can also start the application from your desktop environment's start menu, or you can start it with:

    ```
    foodrescue
    ```


## 5.4. Android Development Setup

1. **Make the development setup for the desktop version.** Follow all steps from chapter "[5.2. Desktop Version Development Setup](#52-desktop-version-development-setup)". Make sure you can build and execute a desktop version; you can also do that during Android development to quickly test code that is not Android-specific.

2. **Create an Android installation directory.** Different from development of a desktop software, all components of the Android software must be installed. This is required for building an Android APK package with `make create-apk`. Note that Food Rescue App and all its custom libraries must be installed into the *same* directory for the Android APK building to succeed (TODO: Confirm that with a fresh build). We'll create an installation directory inside the repository directory of `foodrescue-app` (which you already have from the desktop setup):

    ```
    cd foodrescue-app
    mkdir -p install/android
    ```

3. **Install OpenJDK 8.** This is a dependency of the Android stack and of Qt Creator. Later versions will not work – [see](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-android.html#requirements). And when not doing the `update-alternatives` step, command line utilities that do not inherit the Qt Creator Java path (such as `sdkmanager` when started manually) will fail to run.

    ```
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
    sudo update-alternatives --config java
    ```

4. **Install `sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip`.** Do not install the new edition of this, called "commandlinetools 1.0" as provided on the [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio) ([reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62073804)).
Download and unpack the package to the place that will later also host the Android SDK:

    ```
    cd /opt/android-sdk/
    wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
    unzip sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
    ```

    Make the `sdkmanager` command accessible system-wide:

    ```
    sudo ln -s /opt/android-sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager /usr/local/bin/
    ```

5. **Install the Android stack.** Use the now-installed `sdkmanager` to download the SDK packages required for Android development ([source](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-android.html#requirements)).

    Choose an Android SDK platform (like `platforms;android-29`) that provides at least the API level of your device. Choosing a newer SDK here is no problem, as restricting created APK packages to require a lower API level for installation is possible. The API level number supported by your Android testing device can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms).


    The version of the build tools has to correspond to the version of the Android SDK platform, but will not be the same version. For example in the versions chosen below, indeed, build tools 28.0.2 are required to go together with Android platform SDK 29. The requirements can be found on [this page](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms).

    According to the [official Qt Creator installation instructions](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-android.html#setting-up-the-development-environment), for Qt 5.12.0 to 5.12.5 (which we use here), the correct versions of Android stack packages are installed with the commands below. Except, we stick with Android NDK 18 due to an open issue (TODO: link) in KDE's `extra-cmake-modules` with finding the C++ standard library when using Android NDK ≥19.

    ```
    sdkmanager --install "platform-tools" "platforms;android-29" "build-tools;28.0.2" "ndk;18.1.5063045"
    ```

    Then batch-accept the licences ([see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4682241)):

    ```
    yes | sdkmanager --licenses
    ```

6. **Install Qt for Android.** Needed because the Ubuntu repositories contain only the desktop variant "Qt 5.12.5 (GCC 5.3.1 … 64 bit)". For Android, we need a variant compiled for ARMv7 / ARMv8 architecture instead. The below is the most comfortable way to install Qt for Android; for other options, [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62090264).

    1. **Install [`aqtinstall`](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/).** This is an unofficial installer to install any platform version of Qt on any platform. This is needed because the version of Qt provided in the Ubuntu repositories does not provide the Qt Maintenance Tool that could be used as an alternative.

    2. **Install Qt for Android.** Use `aqtinstall` to install Qt 5.12.5 for Android. This is the version contained in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, matching the version you use for desktop development. Matching versions exactly is not strictly necessary, but avoids surprises and keeping two sets of documentation at hand.

        You can also install Qt 5.13 for Android or higher, but will need additional steps: for Qt 5.13.x or higher, you have to update your `extra-cmake-modules` package manually to 5.68.0 (see chapter [5.1. Version Compatibility Matrix](#51-version-compatibility-matrix)); and for Qt 5.14 or higher additionally you have to [adapt the Android Manifest file](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62108461) of this application. For Qt 5.15, additional steps may be necessary as that has not been tested yet. The next version after Qt 5.15 will probably be Qt 6, to which Kirigami and this application would have to be ported first.

7. **Install Kirigami for Android.** We want to cross-compile an application for Android that depends on Kirigami. Ubuntu repositories do not provide Kirigami built for Android, so we have to do that ourselves. Instructions are mostly [from here](https://community.kde.org/Marble/AndroidCompiling#Setting_up_Kirigami). Note that for desktop builds, we use Kirigami from system packages instead.

    1. Clone the repository inside sub-directory `lib/` of your Food Rescue App project source tree. This is necessary [due to a limitation of the build process](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62326971).

        ```
        cd lib
        git clone https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami.git
        ```

    2. To get Kirigami 5.68.0, the same version as installed for desktop appliction development under Ubuntu 20.04, choose the corresponding commit `f47bf906` ([source](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/tags)):

        ```
        cd kirigami
        git checkout f47bf906
        ```

    3. Run CMake with the environment variables it requires. Be sure to adapt `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to point to your Android installation directory, relative to the Kirigami build directory. (You defined this in step "2. Create an Android installation directory".)

        ```
        mkdir -p build/android && cd build/android

        export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android-sdk
        export ANDROID_NDK=/opt/android-sdk/ndk/18.1.5063045
        export ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=armeabi-v7a
        export ANDROID_PLATFORM=23

        cmake ../.. \
          -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/local/share/ECM/toolchain/Android.cmake \
          -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/qt/5.12.4/android_armv7 \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../../../install/android
        ```

        TODO: Explain what these variables mean.

        TODO: `export ANDROID_PLATFORM=23` might not be required.

    4. Build and install:

        ```
        make
        make install
        ```

8. **Build [ZXing-C++](https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp) for Android.** For Android we obviously cannot do a system-wide installation as this build is not meant for the development host system (and not even executable there). We use the same ZXing repository already cloned while doing the desktop development setup, in the same commit version.

    1. **Enter the repository.**

        ```
        cd /path-to-your/zxing-cpp/
        ```

    2. **Configure the build.** Be sure to point `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to your installation directory; the command below is aleready suitable if you defined it as instructed above.

        Note: The command line options to not build the example applications prevent a build fail in step "Linking CXX executable ZXingWriter" with error message "ZXingWriter.cpp.o: requires unsupported dynamic reloc R_ARM_REL32". We don't need these examples for Android, and they are probably not made for Android anyway.)

        ```
        mkdir -p build/android && cd build/android

        export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android-sdk
        export ANDROID_NDK=/opt/android-sdk/ndk/18.1.5063045
        export ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=armeabi-v7a
        export ANDROID_PLATFORM=23

        cmake ../.. \
          -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/local/share/ECM/toolchain/Android.cmake \
          -DANDROID_SDK_BUILD_TOOLS_REVISION=28.0.2 \
          -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
          -DBUILD_BLACKBOX_TESTS=OFF \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../../foodrescue-app/install/android
        ```

    3. **Build and install.**

        ```
        make
        make install
        ```

9. **Install Breeze icons.** Used for the icons packaged into the Android APK. This is not strictly necessary as the build system will [clone the Breeze repository](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/blob/f47bf90/KF5Kirigami2Macros.cmake#L63)
if it's not found. However, it would clone it into the build directory, and that would happen again whenever clearing the build directory, leading to slow builds.

    1. **Clone the breeze-icons repository.** Sadly you cannot use the Ubuntu-supplied package of Breeze icons (yet) because the build system expects a different folder structure inside. We do a shallow clone of only the last commit's state (`--depth 1`) as that is all we need.

        ```
        cd foodrescue-app/lib
        git clone --depth 1 https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/breeze-icons.git
        ```

        The build system will find the icons in `./lib/breeze-icons` inside the Food Rescue App repository, without further configuration being necessary.

    2. **Configure Qt desktop applications to use Breeze icons.** When developing for Android, compiling and testing changes on the desktop application first is a good way to speed up development. In order to look as much as possible like the Android UI, you want your Qt desktop applications to also use the Breeze icons that get packaged into the Android package.

        This is not guaranteed: Breeze is the default icon theme in KDE Plasma, but if you don't use KDE Plasma then another tool could have selected a different icon theme. And when starting, any Kirigami application like Food Rescue App will simply pick up the Qt icon theme in use.

        So first make sure you have the Breeze icon theme installed:

        ```
        sudo apt install breeze-icon-theme
        ```

        Then make it the default. The places to change the icon theme are as follows:

        * **If you use Lubuntu (LXQt):** In `lxqt-config-appearance`, select "Icons Theme → Breeze".
        * **If you use KDE:** Breeze is the default icon theme, but maybe you changed it before. There is a nice command line way to change it back: `lookandfeeltool -a org.kde.breeze.desktop`.
        * **If you use another desktop environment:** Change the icon theme in the ways your desktop environment wants it to be done. Qt applications should pick up this change.
        * **If nothing else works:** Install the Qt5 Configuration Tool (`sudo apt install qt5ct`) and in tab "Icon Theme" select "Breeze".

9. **Install the database.** Since we installed the food rescue database in the desktop development setup already, we only have to symlink it now into the `src/android/assets/` directory. That will cause it to be included as a file when `make create-apk` creates the Android APK package later. And we'll not have yet another version of the database to keep up to date.

    ```
    ln -s /path/to/your/foodrescue-content.sqlite3 src/android/assets/
    ```


10. **Adapt the makefile.** Due to open issues with the build process, right now you have to adapt `src/CMakeLists.txt` to your system as follows:

    * In `set(foodrescue_EXTRA_LIBS …)` adapt the path to `libQt5Concurrent.so` for your system.


## 5.5. Android Build Process

The following instructions create and install an APK package that will run successfully as an app under Android.

1. **Enter into the repository directory.**

    ```
    cd foodrescue-app
    ```

2. **Run CMake with the environment variables it requires.** The variables and how to adapt them to your system if needed::

    * **`QTANDROID_EXPORTED_TARGET`:** A name component that will appear in Makefile targets to create the Android APK package define by a corresponding variable via `${ANDROID_APK_DIR}/AndroidManifest.xml`. Since we will only run `make && make install` later this name can be anything as it's not used directly, but it has to be define for CMake to not complain.

    * **`ANDROID_APK_DIR`:** A path to the directory in your source tree that contains `AndroidManifest.xml` and also any other files that you want included into the Android APK package. Especially, files placed into an `assets/` sub-directory in here will be available in the Android app's [`assets/` directory](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources#OriginalFiles).

        Placing your `AndroidManifest.xml` here is required in ECM's [`Android.cmake` toolchain l. 211](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/-/blob/master/toolchain/Android.cmake#L211). If this is not set correctly, ECM will use Qt's default manifest template, causing your app package to be named `org.qtproject.example.appname`, the app icons to be missing etc.. While you can use a path relative to the current directory here, it is better to use an absolute path because only that will give an error instead of silently using Qt's default manifest ([see](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/extra-cmake-modules/-/blob/13a1161/toolchain/Android.cmake#L200)).

    * **`CMAKE_ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES`**: Points to directories that will be also be included into the Android `assets/` folder of the Android APK package. Files from here will not be found in the installation directory (`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`), just in the APK package. You do not need to mention `${ANDROID_APK_DIR}/assets/` here, as that is automatically included into the APK's assets directory.

    * **`ECM_DIR`:** TODO: Document.

    * **`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`:** TODO: Document.

    * **`ECM_ADDITIONAL_FIND_ROOT_PATH`:** TODO: Document.

    * **`ANDROID_SDK_BUILD_TOOLS_REVISION`:** TODO: Document.

    * **`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`:** Adapt the value to the installation directory chosen at the start of this "Android Development Setup" section. The directory must be the same for the installation of ZXing, Kirigami and this application. It must be given as an absolute path because the APK creation step after the compilation will fail otherwise. We use `readlink -f` to automatically translate a relative to an absolute path.

    * **`KF5Kirigami2_DIR`:** An absolute path to a directory with the `KF5Kirigami2Config.cmake` file that defines the Kirigami CMake package. It is located in a sub-directory of the installation directory chosen above. CMake configuration with a relative path will fail at least with CMake 3.15.4 or newer. About creating the absolute path with `readlink -f` see on `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

    * **`ZXing_DIR`:** An absolute path to a directory with the `ZXingConfig.cmake` file that defines the ZXing CMake package. It is located in a sub-directory of the installation directory chosen above. About the absolute path see on `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

    The code to run CMake (after you adapted the variables as explained above):

    ```
    mkdir -p build/Android.ConsoleKit && cd build/Android.ConsoleKit3

    export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android-sdk
    export ANDROID_NDK=/opt/android-sdk/ndk/18.1.5063045
    export ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=armeabi-v7a
    export ANDROID_PLATFORM=23

    cmake ../.. \
      -DQTANDROID_EXPORTED_TARGET=foodrescue \
      -DANDROID_APK_DIR=../../src/android \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/local/share/ECM/toolchain/Android.cmake \
      -DECM_ADDITIONAL_FIND_ROOT_PATH=/opt/qt/5.12.4/android_armv7 \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/qt/5.12.4/android_armv7 \
      -DANDROID_SDK_BUILD_TOOLS_REVISION=28.0.2 \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../install/android \
      -DKF5Kirigami2_DIR=$(readlink -f ../../install/android/lib/cmake/KF5Kirigami2) \
      -DZXing_DIR=$(readlink -f ../../install/android/lib/cmake/ZXing)
    ```

    TODO: The line `export ANDROID_PLATFORM=23` might not be needed.

3. **Build the application.** You could also just `make` first to see if the compilation step is successful. Note that `make install` is necessary before every `make create-apk` as otherwise newly added files like icons would not land in the Android APK package. Only the files found in `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` when `make create-apk` runs will make it to the APK package! (This should be considered a bug in the build dependencies and we'll try to get it fixed.)

    ```
    make install
    make create-apk
    ```

4. **Install the application to your Android device.** First enable `adb` debug mode on your Android device, pair it with `adb` on the computer, and then execute:

    ```
    make install-apk-foodrescue
    ```

    This command might not work due to an unresolved issue in ECM about naming the APK file. In that case, you can run the following command to install the APK:

    ```
    adb install -r ./foodrescue_build_apk//build/outputs/apk/debug/foodrescue_build_apk-debug.apk
    ```

    Both commands will first remove a previous version of the app from the device if necessary, but without removing application data or granted permissions. If you rather want to do a completely clean install (for example because you want to force using a new version of the database that is bundled into the APK package), then rather use do this:

    ```
    adb uninstall org.fairdirect.foodrescue
    adb install ./foodrescue_build_apk//build/outputs/apk/debug/foodrescue_build_apk-debug.apk
    ```


You can also build this the Android application from inside Qt Creator. See chapter [5.4. Qt Creator configuration](54-qt-creator-configuration).


## 5.6. Qt Creator Setup

### Building the Food Rescue App Linux desktop application

1. **Install Qt Creator.** Under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you can:

    ```
    sudo apt install qtcreator qtcreator-doc
    ```

2. **Open the project.** In Qt Creator, go to "File → Open File or Project…" and open the project's `CMakeLists.txt`.

3. **Configure the build targets.** Select the "Projects" tab from the sidebar and configure the project's build targets (TODO: how).

4. **Build and run the application.** In the lower left build control toolbar, select your build target and then click the large green "Run" button.


### Building the Food Rescue App Android application

We could not yet build Food Rescue App for Android with Qt Creator. The instructions below are still incomplete.

TODO: Finish the instructions, and test them for Food Rescue App.

1. **Install Qt Creator.** ⚠️ ⚠️ Exceptionally, the instructions here use Qt Creator 4.12.1, not the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS provided version. Because Qt Creator 4.12 introduced major improvements in the Android build process. You can install Qt Creator 4.12.1 with [`aqtinstall`](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/) as follows:

    ```
    # TODO: installation instructions
    ```

    If you rather want to use Qt Creator from the Ubuntu repositories, you can do the following instead. It will give you Qt Creator 4.11.0 under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ([see](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/+package/qtcreator)) and Qt Creator 4.8 under Ubuntu 19.10 (ca. 14 months older, [see](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=qtcreator)). The packages with `i386` architecture are needed on 64 bit systems; otherwise Qt Creator would not find Android devices to deploy to ([see](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-getting-started.html#linux-64-bit)).

    ```
    sudo apt install qtcreator qtcreator-doc libstdc++6:i386 libgcc1:i386 zlib1g:i386 libncurses5:i386
    ```

2. **Make the Android SDK and NDK writable.** Reason: "Make sure to unpack the Android SDK and NDK to a writeable location that Qt Creator can access later. Otherwise, Qt Creator won't be able to use sdkmanager or find all components even if they were installed manually." ([source](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-getting-started.html)).

    Execute the following command, with the username of the user running Qt Creator usually:

    ```
    chown username:username -R /opt/android/sdk/ /opt/android-ndk/
    ```

3. **Install `CMakeLists.txt.user.template` as a starting point.** This file is provided in the repository as a template for the Qt Creator local project settings file and save you most of the steps listed below. To install it, copy it to `CMakeLists.txt.user` before starting Qt Creator:

    ```
    cp CMakeLists.txt.user.template CMakeLists.txt.user
    ```

4. **Configure Qt Creator for your environment.**

    1. Under  "Tools → Options… → Kits → Qt versions", configure the paths of your new Qt installations.

    2. Under "Tools → Options… → Devices → Android", configure the paths to your Android SDK and NDK.

5. **Make sure there is a kit.** Connect your Android device by USB cable and under "Tools → Options → Kits → Kits" make sure there is an auto-generated kit for this device.

6. **Create the project's build configuration.** Open the "Food Rescue App" projects by opening its `CMakeLists.txt`. Then via the left sidebar, go to "Projects → Build & Run" and:

    1. Configure your project for the Qt Creator kit corresponding to your Android device.

    2. Under "Build & Run → [kit name] → Edit build configuration: Release → CMake", set the correct CMake variables needed for the build process, equivalent to the settings made during the command line build process. (TODO: How. Especially since some of the command line variables could only be set as environment variables, not via a `cmake -D` switch.)

7. **Build and deploy to Android.**

    1. In the bottom left of the Qt Creator window, click on the dropdown button to select your build configuration, and select your project's new Android release build configuration.

    2. Before the first deploy, enable `adb` debug mode on the Android device.

    3. Click the large green arrow button to start the build and deployment process. It should first open a window to let you choose your Android device. If not, follow "[Selecting Android Devices](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-android.html#selecting-android-devices)".


### Building Kirigami for Android

We could not yet build Kirigami for Android with Qt Creator. Since it's a library that you only need to build once, setting up Qt Creator for this task also makes little sense. You'll be fine with the build instructions for the command line, see above.


### Improving your Qt Creator setup

If you use Qt Creator as your IDE, here are ways to make developing for this (and other) applications pleasant and efficient:

1. **If not on Ubuntu: Adapt your `QML_IMPORT_PATH`.** The `QML_IMPORT_PATH` is needed for Qt Creator's code completion to work. Otherwise, it will complain at QML `import` statements but builds would still succeed. This application already defines `QML_IMPORT_PATH` for all required QML files as found in Ubuntu Linux based distributions, using [this technique](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62202304). If you're not on Ubuntu, you may have to add some directories by defining CMake variable `QML_IMPORT_PATH` according to [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62222947).

2. **Install the Android examples.** The following will install relevant Qt examples for Android development, leaving out other examples. Note that for each example, three packages are needed: source files, API docs (used for the help system) and HTML docs (used for the example index in the welcome page etc.). We avoid installing packages `qt5-examples`, `qt5-doc` and `qt5-doc-html` as each of these would bring in documentation and other material from unnecessary examples.

    ```
    sudo apt install qtbase5-examples qtdeclarative5-doc qtdeclarative5-doc-html qtdeclarative5-examples qtquickcontrols2-5-doc qtquickcontrols2-5-doc-html qtquickcontrols2-5-examples qtsensors5-doc qtsensors5-doc-html qtsensors5-examples qtxmlpatterns5-doc qtxmlpatterns5-doc-html qtxmlpatterns5-examples qtconnectivity5-examples qtconnectivity5-doc qtconnectivity5-doc-html qtdatavisualization5-examples qtdatavisualization5-doc qtdatavisualization5-doc-html qtmultimedia5-examples qtmultimedia5-doc qtmultimedia5-doc-html qtsvg5-examples qtsvg5-doc qtsvg5-doc-html qttools5-examples qttools5-doc qttools5-doc-html qtwayland5-examples qtwayland5-doc qtwayland5-doc-html qtxmlpatterns5-examples qtxmlpatterns5-doc qtxmlpatterns5-doc-html
    ```

3. **Adapt the default build path.** You can set it to whatever you want of course, but pretty sure you're not happy with the long default build directory names. It can be adapted under "Tools → Options → Build & Run → Default Build Properties → Default build directory". I like to set mine to:

   ```
   build/%{JS: Util.asciify("%{CurrentKit:FileSystemName}.%{CurrentBuild:Name}")}
   ```


# 6. Release Process

The default build type is "Debug". To create a release build that is ready for packaging and uploading, follow the process below:


## 6.1. Desktop Linux

TODO


## 6.2. F-Droid

TODO


## 6.3. Google Play

This does not describe the initial setup to be able to upload the application to Google Play for the first time. For that, [see here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469). Instead, this is the process to follow to upload any update to the application to Google Play.

1. **Configure package signing.** This is necessary only the first time you start creating Android packages for Google Play on a new device. Alternatively and probably more comfortably, use [app signing by Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423).

    Even with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` passed to the `cmake` call, the generated Android APK package will sill be named `foodrescue_build_apk-debug.apk`. This is because a release package will only be generated when you provide a certificate for signing – which can be considered a bug in `androiddeployqt` ([details](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28509035)). TODO: How to configure package signing.

2. **Update the version.** TODO

3. **Create a release build.** To control the build type, use `cmake` variable [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html). For a release build, use:

    ```
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```

    TODO: Change this to the RelMinSize or similar value to create a minimum size release package.

4. **Create an AAB package.** An AAB (Android Application Bundle) combines the APK packages of multiple processor architectures (ABIs, meaning Application Binary Interface). The ABIs to support are only **`armeabi-v7a` and `arm64-v8a`** (the "newer version"). Together these account for 98% of all Android devices in use ([see](https://android.stackexchange.com/a/202022)). Also, native apps must support both `armeabi-v7a` and `arm64-v8a` to be publishable on Google Play ([see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53413715)).

    Typically, processors supporting `arm64-v8a` also support code made for `armeabi-v7a` but it will run slower, not utilizing the full capabilities of the CPU ([see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33230181)). So for testing or for publishing outside Google Play, a single APK made for `armeabi-v7a` is enough.

    For end users, support for the `x86` and `x86_64` ABIs only matters with respect to Chromebooks ([see](https://android.stackexchange.com/a/202022)). Most Chromebooks still use the x86 and x86_64 processor architecture and only some use ARM based processors. However, since Chromebooks can also run Linux desktop applications ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook#Integration_with_Linux)), that seems to be a better route for a cross-platform application like this to support them, given that they are more like a notebook than like a typical Android phone or tablet.

    Finally, support for the `x86` and `x86_64` ABIs would also be relevant for Android emulators. But for a cross-platform application that also runs natively under Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, emulators are only useful for developers during testing. And developers can build their own version anyway.

5. **Log in to Google Play Console.** Use any Google account to register on [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/), the place for publishing Android apps on Google Play.

6. **Update the screenshots.** If there were significant changes to the user interface, run the application under Android and create screenshots for uploading to Google Play. For that, execute something like this to update one of the screenshots for a 7" tablet saved in the Food Rescue App repository. The `convert` command requires to have ImageMagick installed.

    ```
    cd /path/to/foodrescue-app/
    adb exec-out screencap -p > metadata-screenshot-tablet7-1.png
    convert -quality 75 metadata-screenshot-tablet7-1.png metadata-screenshot-tablet7-1.jpg
    ```

    Then upload the screensots to Google Play Console under "All Apps → Food Rescue → Store Entry".

7. **Upload to Google Play.** TODO.


## 6.4. Apple AppStore

TODO


# 7. Style Guide

## 7.1. Code Style

The guiding idea is to write code that reads almost like natural language. That affects variable and method naming, source code layout and also choice of the logical flow and distributing algorithmic complexity so that one can understand everything while reading through once.

**Specific code style hints for C++:**

TODO

**Specific code style hints for QML:**

* **Assign IDs generously.** Every QML object can have an `id:` property, but only those references from the outside need one. However, assigning IDs with well-chosen names is code-as-documentation, defining the purpose and relations of the object without an additional comment.

* **Namespace use for imports.** All Qt5 provided QML is imported without a namespace – this is the "default stuff" that should be available directly. Everything else should be imported using a namespace, because only then it's clear where to look up documentation of an element found in the source code. (Also Kirigami uses some of the same names as Qt QML, which would add to the confusion without namespaces; e.g. Action, Label.) So all Kirigami QML imports are `import … as Kirigami` and all QML elements defined in the C++ part of this same application are imported as `import … as Local`.

* **Order of elements.** Use the following order when defining or instantiating and refining a QML type. It helps navigating the code because one will know where to look for a specific element, similar to how people often typically use an "attributes, public methods, private methods" order in classes.

    * **Identifying properties.** (`id`, `title` etc.)
    * **Custom signals, custom properties.**
    * **Properties.**
    * **Signal handlers, functions.** Similar to how methods typically come after attributes, we place behavior after properties.
    * **Invisible QML objects.** For example `Camera { … }`.
    * **Visible QML elements.** Nested in their layouts and in their visual order in the user interface (top to bottom, left to right). This can include both instantiated QML objects and properties (such as `Kirigami::Page.actions`) that define visual elements – which then is an exception from the rule above that places properties near the start.


## 7.2. Documentation Style

**Outsource to Stack Exchange.** To keep this README and other documentation short and to avoid mentioning the same instructions in multiple places, publish re-usable Q&A style instructions as answers to suitable questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or if necessary one of its sister sites. And include just the hyperlink into the project documentation. This also lets others profit from your re-usable pieces of knowledge. Stack Exchange is reasonably stable, so it can be assumed that the links will rot slower than this software itself.
