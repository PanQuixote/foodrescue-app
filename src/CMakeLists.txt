#   To browse available icons to choose from, see: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_icon_sets

#   theme. No need to bundle icons here, as the application package will depend on an icon theme
#   being installed. But on Android, there is no system-wide icon theme, so you have to list the
#   icons that your application uses.
#
#   The icons bundled into the Android APK here are from "Breeze", the default KDE5 icon theme.
#
#   TODO: What happens when building for on iOS, Windows and Mac OS X?
#
#   Some Breeze icons are used by Kirigami components themselves and always bundled into an Android
#   APK. They can be re-used in the application without increasing file size. For Kirigami 5.68.0,
#   these icons are:
